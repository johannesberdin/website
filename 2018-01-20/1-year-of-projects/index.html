      <p>This is a premiere, my first article ever! In the last few days I have thought a lot about a good start but even more I have thought about why I was so quite on the Internet in <a href="#fn">recent years</a> despite the fact I had a crazy time in a digital world and that's the reason I want to share some of my ideas, projects, fails, experiences and daily thoughts. I hope I'm able to inspire someone and I would love to have a deeper conversations with you, so do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>You probably never heard about me so let me introduce myself. My name is Johannes Berdin, I'm 29 years old and I'm living in a truly beautiful part of Germany, called <a href="#fn">Saarland</a>. I'm project lead and software developer at <a href="#fn">Eyeled GmbH</a>, a software company specialized in mobile IT solutions for industry-leading businesses and medium-sized enterprises. I'm also founder of the apptimists a small app company doing business as <a href="#fn">StauMobil</a>, a free app for iOS and Android providing traffic information for Germany. I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at Universit√§t des Saarlandes and at time of writing I'm applicant of <a href="#fn">Wirtschaftsjunioren Saarland</a>.</p>
<p>I like to explain - you probably noticed that by the five footnotes within the first paragraph. I think it's because my dad is the principal of an advanced highschool and I also started studying teaching profession but that's another story.</p>
<p>In this article I want to share some of my New Year's resolutions. Some are just thoughts like &quot;It would be cool to have that&quot;-stuff. For some I'm looking for help or better I defintely need help to get them running. I guess some will be just random and a lot will be in tech space.</p>
<h3>My Golf II</h3>
<p>Two years ago my brother gave me the papers for a white <a href="#fn">Volkswagen Golf II</a> because he upgraded to a larger car and the Golf started to get some aches. It is not diagnosed but it feels like something's wrong with the gear. Apart from that there are some beauty mistakes in the interior which should be fixed too.
But it would be a very simple project to just tow the car into the next garage and get it fixed. I would like to have some specials for that almost 30 year old car. These are my current thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>lock/unlock doors via smartphone</li>
<li>LTE internet connection</li>
<li>geo-locate my car and store the GPS tracks</li>
<li><a href="#fn">clever</a> power supply</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how the project evolves I'll keep you updated but if you know a good mechanic around the area of Saarlouis please drop me a line!</p>
<h3>Some apptimists insights</h3>
<p>Oh my gosh the apptimists are operating since 2012 and even if we are the One and a Half Men show since one and a half years we made some great experiences which I want to share with you.
I especially want to thank my co-founder and very good friend Andy for the past time and I'm looking forward to upcoming adventures.
I think writing about that will be a kind of recap for me in first place about what worked, what did not work that well and what totally failed so others, addressing not only startups, are not doing the same mistakes, are able to accelerate faster and get better chances to succeed.
Therefore I will provide an article section at the apptimists website and publish all company-related stuff there.</p>
<h3>Sorting, searching in the mess</h3>
<p>I do delete unnecessary data. Typically when I download something, check it out, delete the file from the Downloads folder and really try to not waste disk space with useless data and files but...
When it has to go fast or because I think I could use the file or data in a .1 percent chance I do not delete it. Actually there is no excuse for that but over the time my desktop gets polluted and is a total mess.
The next remote session is getting closer and I do what everyone would do. I create a folder on my Desktop, name it &quot;Desktop&quot; and drag all files from the original desktop over there. Out of sight, out of mind. And guess what: after a while I've another &quot;Desktop&quot; folder on my desktop including a folder named &quot;Desktop&quot; and so on.
I really hate that, especially when I'm doing my full backups once in a while because then I also archive the mess - on purpose. And it would be great to have a system which automatically classifies the contents of my messy folders and helps me to decide if I can delete them or not. That's what I'm trying to build.
If you are a machine learning expert and want to contribute to this project send me a message.</p>
<h3>StauMobil v5</h3>
<p>Do you know <a href="#fn">Pareto principle</a>, also known as the 80/20 rule? This phenomenon kicked in twice for the release of the next version of the StauMobil app in the beginning of last year. I finished University and started my full-time job. I won't excuse the long waiting time because creating something takes time and that's what I'll write about in this project: the hurdles we had to take for the complete remake, what we changed, what tools we used and use now and all that stuff.
In review it would have been better to inform our patient and awesome users due that process but afterwards one is always smarter.
The app will be released in the next days so be surprised what we did!</p>
<h3>Picstabox</h3>
<p>At least <a href="#fn">1.2 trillion photos</a> were taken in 2017 that are 22,916 moments captured every second. I think this is a amazing number.
My brother Peter, our friend Pascal and I built a photo box to capture moments at parties, personal and business events. We finished the hardware and software setup in the middle of last year and successfully passed stress tests like 24h use, low-light environment and unclimated rooms.
We are now developing an online booking system where people easily can rent the box.
If you want to collect moments of your next event you can get a promotional discount until March by mailing me.</p>
<h3>Viez the Cola</h3>
<p>Do you know Cola-Viez also called Viez-Cola? Probably not because it is a super regional special mix.<br/>To emphasize how regional it is imagine a square of 50x50 kilometers, thats the 2600 square kilometer sized state in Germany I'm living in and over the last 12 years I didn't recognize this particular beverage people drink just 25km away.
And what's so special? Think of a still cidre mixed with coke. So you have the sugar-sweet flavor of coke mixed with bitter taste of the apple wine and within the right mixing ratio it is awesome!
And where is the project here? So Tobi, a good friend, and I will start a small manufacture for creating different versions of Cola-Viez, bottle them in small batches and sell them via an online shop.
We already checked the regulations and are currently working on the bottle designs and developing the web shop thus we are live in the mid of this year. Be curious!</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I do love books. I really love books but of unknown reasons I did not read one book in the last years. Actually I did a quick check on Amazon for the latest book purchase but those data was out of record. At Christmas day I bought <a href="#fn">&quot;A Brief History of Humankind&quot; by Yuval Noah Harari</a> via the Kindle iPad app. I sucked the chapters and also highlighted some brilliant explanations but then I noticed that you are not able to publicly share those quotes via web nevermind the books you are currently reading.
Flying over the Google search results I did not find a service for that but it does not seems that hard to use an API or crawl the data from my Amazon profile so let's see what I can do here.
Btw. I would be very happy to get some book recommendations for non-fiction books.</p>
<p>So these are my projects for this year. What are yours? Hope you enjoyed reading and stay tuned!
